-: Status:
	-I am working through the professor's notes to make sure that I meet his goals.
	-Otherwise, the document and it's various stylesheets and machines are working at ~98% accuracy.
	
-: Limitations:
	-I have not yet learned anything about responsive design as a whole.
		-the result of that is that this website is not responsive in some situations.
		-for that reason, it is //best viewed at 1920x1080 on a PC in Chrome//
		
-: TODO:
	Confirm site meets professors request
	Correct various script behaviors - scrolling, nav bar touchy, no on hover for nav buttons
	Add a more elastic design framework to the entire page
		-develop a better standard for the "default" design 
			- ie: one single stylesheet for the overall theme
				- I've done this, just not well.
				
-: Notes:
	My HTML templates were generated using HTML Boilerplate in VS Code.

---------A Bit of Backstory---------

Eek's Attic is a business that my wife and I own. We sell women's clothing online. I have been maintaining that Shopify website for a couple years now.
In that mission, I have been engaged in various HTML/CSS edits, but I've been afraid to ruin everything so I haven't done much with it.
While this class didn't expand a //whole// lot on the knowledge I already had, my approach to the challenges has taught me a lot about web development
in general and my ability to use JS/jQuery has expanded significantly as well (which is my ultimate goal, tbh). 



---------MY INTERP---------

Create a simple whole web site for a business using your knowledge.

    The business should:
        : sell different product lines or services
            : 'A well thought out web site should be developed.  Please put forth effort on this project'
            : rough guideline - http://www.aromaoilstore.com/
	
	Conform to various demands as listed below.





---------PROF REQUEST---------

The final project is to create a simple whole web site for a business using what you have learnt in this course or on you own. 
The business is one that sell different product lines or services. 
A well thought out web site should be developed.  
Please put forth effort on this project as you may be asked to show a project you have done when you are looking for a employment in the web related field.  
The information below is just a rough guideline you may develop a more functional, complex pages.  
You can look at this site and its codes at http://www.aromaoilstore.com/.  
You will not be expect to create a complete web site like it but do your best to create a well structured web site.

The very first thing to do is to figure out the business you are creating for. 
Usually you would create a folder with the business's name.  
	E.g. MickeysProduce, ChinaWok, GoodTimeSpiritNWine.  
The point is to create a main folder with an appropriate name.  
Be aware that the file or folder name may not contain apostrophy, comma, quotation, astric etc. 
This folder should have only one html document, the index.html file.

Now, everything should go be placed inside this folder.  
You will need to think of a proper structures for the web site. 
You should have subfolders to organize you pages.  
Inside you main folder, create a folder called Media, a folder named Products(or Services), a folder called CustomerServices, folder called CssAndScripts and any other folders needed for the site.
The Products folder will have one or more web pages, so you would need to create the supporting folder- the Media for storing images and videos.
Say the business concerned sales product A, product B and Product C, 
	eg. one what sells clothes, shoes, bags.  
Inside the Products or services folder, create a folder for each product line. 
	Eg A folder for clothes, one for shoes, and one for bags. 
Inside each product line folder, 
	eg. in the clothes folder, create a folder called Media. 
Do the same for other product line.
So far you have a main folder which is usually named the same as the business name.  
In there you have 4 folders: Media, Products(or services), CustomerServices, and CssAndScripts.  
The Products folder in turn has 3 folders (one for each product line) in addition to the supporting folder- the media folder. 
Finally each product line has its supporting folders. 
The number of folders you created depends on the complexity of the web sites.  
The numbers  I put forth is just the bare requirements for this project.
Now think about the web pages you need to create.  
You need one in the main folder which is called index.html.  
This page will be the starting page that contains a welcoming statement, a statement of what the business sells, a link to a page in the Product folder, a link to the CustomerServices. 
Any image or video that is displayed in this page should be placed in the Media folder here. 
In the Products folder, create another html file called index.html.  
This will be the default page for this folder. 
This page should introduce the different products and services and should contain the links to each product line and may be each product, depending on how you structure this page. 
Any images or video used in this page should be placed in the right folders contained in the Product folder, not else where.
In each product line folder create an index.html files that show the different products.  
Usually in an actual web page here, there will be a button that let allow you to "place the product in the shopping cart".  
The implementation of a shopping cart requires you to learn server scripting which is not covered here.  
You only need to include the button. 
You can fill in the contents for other folders and pages.  
The point of this project is to impress you to implement a good structure to you web site, not just whole bunch of files placed in one folder.  
Also remember that if you are selling products or services, you want to show the products as quickly as possible.  
The general rule is that not more that 2 clicks away from the main page. 
Please use the latest HTML standards, ie HTML5 to complete this assignment. 
Please use external CSS and make sure that you have a proper navigation system. 
On each page, you should have links to all other pages.  
An example of the folder structure is included in the next link.
